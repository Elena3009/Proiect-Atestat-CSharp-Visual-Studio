# Proiect-Atestat-CSharp-Visual-Studio
This project represents my high school graduation exam (Atestat) developed at "Aurel Vlaicu" National College. It is a Windows Forms application built using C# and Visual Studio, designed to demonstrate my foundational knowledge in software development, user interface design, and logic implementation.
